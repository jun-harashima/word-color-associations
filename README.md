# Word-Color Associations in Japanese

This is the first resource for Japanese word-color associations. The resource includes a total of 2,903 Japanese words.

## Color associations with contexts

In the resource, three contexts are given for each word and color associations are given for each context as follows.

- **危険** (**danger**)	  950106118-019   red: 5, yellow: 4, purple: 1, orange: 1  
- **危険** (**danger**)   950107036-002   red: 4, yellow: 4, gray: 2, pink: 1  
- **危険** (**danger**)   950106128-014   red: 6, black: 2, gray: 2, green: 1  

The values correspond to the number of participants who associated the color with the word in the given context.

For contexts, we randomly chose sentences containing the target words from [Kyoto University Text Corpus](http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/index.php?Kyoto%20University%20Text%20Corpus) (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998), in which an unique ID such as 950107036-002 is given for each sentence as follows.

950107036-002: ... 危険なことをトライさせて見物するという ... (... program that places the cast members in danger ...)

## Color associations without contexts

We also collected Japanese word-color associations without contexts. The color associations are given for each word as follows.

- **危険** (**danger**)   red: 7, yellow: 3, black : 1
